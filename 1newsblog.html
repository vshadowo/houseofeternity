<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">I have started progress on this website! I'm very excited to get work done on Arbiter-Persists. There is a lot of things I will need to get done, and it may take a while, but it's nice to know I can send and archive my progress here. As of today, I've gotten the website set up and will begin work to tidy it up and make it look all nice ^^</span></p>
